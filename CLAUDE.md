# CLAUDE.md — Endfield Terrain Generator

## Overview

WallpaperV2 is a browser-based wallpaper generator inspired by the visual design language of **Arknights: Endfield**. It produces topographic terrain maps overlaid with industrial/military HUD elements, mixed Japanese and English text labels, and print-production marks -- all rendered to an HTML Canvas and exportable as high-resolution PNGs.

Everything runs **pure client-side** (React + TypeScript + Tailwind). There is no backend; terrain generation, contour extraction, and all rendering happen in the browser. Users configure the output through a control panel, then export or share a permalink.

### Visual Aesthetic

The design draws from Endfield's packaging, merchandise, and in-game UI (reference images in `style/` and `style_v2/`). Key visual traits:

- **Color palette** -- Yellow (#FFE600) is the signature accent, with support for red, cyan, green, purple, white, gray, and black alternates. Light and dark themes swap the background between off-white (#F5F5F5) and near-black (#1A1A1A). Both accent and contour line colors are independently user-selectable from the same 8-color palette plus a custom color picker.
- **Topographic contour lines** -- Simplex-noise heightmaps produce organic contour lines in mono, elevation-gradient, or fade color modes. Contour line color is independently configurable from the accent color. An optional glow effect (via Canvas `shadowBlur`) can be layered on top of any color mode, controlled by an intensity slider.
- **Mixed-language text** -- Japanese labels (e.g. "暴雨予警", "地形調査", "探査レベル") and English labels ("TERRAIN SURVEY", "VALLEY PASS", "MOUNTAIN CONTOUR") are scattered as annotations. CJK text uses Noto Sans JP / system CJK fonts; technical readouts use a clean sans-serif.
- **Industrial marks** -- CMYK registration dots, hazard stripes, yellow accent bars with chevron arrows stamped "ARKNIGHTS: ENDFIELD", diagonal hatching patches, small scattered crosshair (+) marks, diamond accent markers (solid and hatched), corner brackets, center crosshairs, and edge midpoint ticks.
- **Territory zones** -- Irregular angular polygons generated via Voronoi tessellation (d3-delaunay), filled with diagonal crosshatch lines. Seed points are biased toward heightmap peaks/valleys so zone boundaries semi-align with contour features. Zones are merged using contour-threshold-aligned elevation bands with gradient-aware constraints, then isolated so no two zones share edges.
- **HUD overlays** -- Grid lines, scan lines, reticle targets, data panels (with translucent background) with coordinates/elevation/frequency readouts, and corner metadata blocks.

### The Endfield Font

`public/fonts/EndfieldByButan.ttf` is a custom display font where standard ASCII characters map to **decorative symbol glyphs** (geometric shapes, arrows, custom marks). When you type normal Latin text, it renders as seemingly garbled symbols. **This is intentional and desired** -- the garbled look IS the Endfield aesthetic. The font is used for hero text, accent bar labels, and the control panel header title.

The control panel itself uses `font-sans` (system sans-serif) for readability. Canvas text routing is handled by `src/utils/fonts.ts` which selects between `'endfield'`, `'standard'` (Inter/Helvetica), or `'auto'` (CJK detection) font stacks depending on the text content and intended use.

### User Experience

The app is a responsive single-viewport layout that adapts to screen size using a `lg:` breakpoint (1024px):

**Desktop (≥ 1024px):** Side-by-side layout with canvas preview filling the left area and the control panel as a static 288px sidebar on the right.

**Mobile / tablet (< 1024px):** The canvas takes the full viewport. The control panel is hidden behind a **slide-out drawer** triggered by a floating yellow hamburger button (fixed, bottom-right, `z-20`). The drawer slides in from the right as a fixed overlay (`z-40`) with a semi-transparent backdrop (`z-30`). Close via the X button in the drawer header or by tapping the backdrop. Implemented in `ControlPanel.tsx` which renders both wrappers (desktop `hidden lg:flex` and mobile `lg:hidden`) around a shared `PanelContent` inner component.

**Canvas preview** -- The preview renders the **same content as the export**, preserving the configured aspect ratio and fitting it into the container (letterboxed if necessary). The render resolution is capped at 2048px on the longest axis for performance; CSS sizing matches the fitted dimensions so nothing is stretched. Exports render at the exact configured resolution via a separate canvas in `export.ts`. The canvas re-renders whenever config changes, with a three-tier caching system (see below) to minimize redundant work.

**Control panel** -- A scrollable panel organized into labeled sections:

1. **Presets** -- Seven curated style buttons that apply a full config snapshot (all settings except resolution and seed).
2. **Resolution** -- Dropdown for 1080p, 1440p, 4K, ultrawide (3440x1440), Your Device (auto-detected hardware pixels), or custom width/height inputs. On mobile (screen width < 1024), the default is "Your Device" which reads `screen.width * devicePixelRatio` x `screen.height * devicePixelRatio` for a pixel-perfect phone wallpaper.
3. **Theme** -- Light/dark toggle and accent color picker (8 preset swatches + custom color input).
4. **Terrain Parameters** -- Seed text input plus sliders for noise scale, octaves, persistence, and contour levels.
5. **Contour Style** -- Tri-state selector for contour color mode (mono, elevation, fade), contour line color picker (8 swatches + custom), and glow intensity slider.
6. **Layers** -- Eleven independent toggles controlling which overlay layers are drawn (grid, annotations, Japanese text, frames, accents, scan lines, data panel, reticles, corner data, zones, hero text).
7. **Icon** -- Logo variant selector (None / Endfield Industries / English / Japanese / Korean / Chinese), scale slider (5%-100%), opacity slider (5%-100%), and color picker. Controls only shown when a variant is selected.
8. **Output** -- Resolution picker and action buttons: Randomize (re-rolls all parameters, colors, toggles, and contour mode), Export PNG, Copy Link.

### Preset System

Seven curated presets, each a complete config snapshot:

| Preset | Theme | Accent | Character |
|---|---|---|---|
| Field Report | Dark | Yellow | Core industrial look (floor_plating/store), all overlays on, grey mono contours |
| Storm Warning | Dark | Yellow | Dense contours (28 levels, 6 octaves), elevation coloring with glow, hero text |
| Minimal Survey | Light | Grey | Clean print aesthetic, stripped-down: no annotations, no CJK, fade contours |
| Classified | Dark | Red | Military redacted look, red-tinted contours with glow, hero text, all data overlays |
| Deep Terrain | Dark | Yellow | World map view (30 levels, 5 octaves), elevation coloring, dense zones and data |
| Signal Lost | Dark | Cyan | Sparse eerie scan, cyan fade contours with glow, scan lines + reticles + zones |
| Holographic | Dark | Amber | Glowing amber contour lines (holographic_topography), full glow, minimal overlays |

Presets do NOT override resolution or seed, so users can apply a style then fine-tune dimensions and terrain independently.

### Export and Sharing

- **PNG Export** -- Renders at full configured resolution (up to 4K) using `OffscreenCanvas` when available, falls back to a DOM canvas. Downloads as `endfield-terrain-{seed}-{width}x{height}.png`. The export is completely independent of the preview — it creates its own canvas at the exact configured dimensions.
- **Permalink** -- The full `WallpaperConfig` object is JSON-serialized, base64-encoded, and placed in the URL hash fragment (`#<base64>`). Sharing this URL reproduces the exact wallpaper. The URL is updated via `history.replaceState` (no page reload) and decoded on load.
- **localStorage persistence** -- Every config update is also saved to `localStorage` (key: `endfield-terrain-config`). Returning users who visit without a URL hash get their last config restored automatically.

## Rendering Pipeline

`renderWallpaper(canvas, config, dpr)` in `src/engine/renderer.ts` executes an async pipeline:

1. **Font loading** -- `loadCanvasFont()` loads the custom Endfield `.ttf` via the FontFace API (cached after first load).
2. **HiDPI buffer setup** -- Canvas buffer is set to `width * dpr` x `height * dpr` (only resized when dimensions change to avoid clearing the visible canvas). All drawing uses logical coordinates.
3. **Grid sizing** -- The heightmap grid targets ~250 cells on the longer axis, maintaining the output aspect ratio.
4. **Heightmap generation** -- `generateHeightmap()` in `terrain.ts` produces a `Float64Array` of fractal octave simplex noise, normalized to [0, 1]. Each octave multiplies frequency by `lacunarity` and amplitude by `persistence`. **Cached** -- see Caching Strategy below.
5. **Contour extraction** -- `extractContours()` in `contours.ts` feeds the heightmap into `d3-contour`'s marching-squares generator with `smooth(true)`, returning `ContourData[]` (threshold value + MultiPolygon coordinates). **Cached** -- see Caching Strategy below.
6. **RenderContext assembly** -- Bundles dimensions, config, contour data, heightmap, and the `ThemePalette`. Each layer receives its own seeded RNG (`seed + '_' + layerName`) and its own `OffscreenCanvas` context for caching.
7. **Layer rendering + caching** -- Each layer renders to its own cached `OffscreenCanvas`. Only layers whose cache key has changed are re-rendered. Toggle-gated layers are skipped entirely when their `show*` flag is false.
8. **Compositing** -- All enabled layers' cached canvases are composited onto the main canvas via `drawImage` calls (pixel-to-pixel, ~1-2ms total).

## Render Layers (composition order)

| # | Layer | File | Toggle | Description |
|---|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **background** | `background.ts` | always | Solid fill using `palette.background` |
| 2 | **grid** | `grid.ts` | `showGrid` | Major (1/8 width) and minor (1/32 width) grid lines with alphanumeric coordinate labels at intersections |
| 3 | **scanLines** | `scanLines.ts` | `showScanLines` | 3-6 faint horizontal + 2-4 vertical lines at random positions, plus one dashed accent line |
| 4 | **contourLines** | `contourLines.ts` | always | Draws all contour paths scaled from grid-space to canvas-space. Every 5th contour is an "index" contour (thicker). Color varies by `contourColorMode`. Optional glow via `contourGlow` intensity (Canvas `shadowBlur` in accent color) |
| 5 | **zones** | `zones.ts` | `showZones` | 3-5 irregular angular territory polygons with diagonal crosshatch fill and border strokes. Generated via Voronoi tessellation with terrain-biased seed points, contour-aligned banding, and gradient-aware merging. Zones are isolated (no shared edges). 1-2 zones highlighted with accent border, each labeled from `EN_LABELS` |
| 6 | **heroText** | `heroText.ts` | `showHeroText` | A single large word rendered as a very faint watermark (6% opacity) with shadow echo and accent underline. Uses the Endfield font |
| 7 | **annotations** | `annotations.ts` | `showAnnotations` | 10-16 scattered text labels chosen from EN, JP (if CJK enabled), and data-format pools. Zone-based placement across a 4x3 grid prevents clustering |
| 8 | **reticles** | `reticles.ts` | `showReticles` | 2-4 tactical targeting symbols (circle, diamond, or square variant) biased toward canvas corners |
| 9 | **cornerData** | `cornerData.ts` | `showCornerData` | Top-left: environmental readouts. Top-right: lat/lon coordinates + grid reference. Bottom-left: classification ID stamp |
| 10 | **frames** | `frames.ts` | `showFrames` | Inner border rectangle, L-shaped corner brackets, center crosshair with circle, and edge midpoint ticks |
| 11 | **dataPanel** | `dataPanel.ts` | `showDataPanel` | Structured info panel in bottom-right: translucent background, accent-colored header bar, 5-7 key/value rows, optional CJK footer. Min width 140px; drawing is clipped to panel bounds to prevent text overflow on small canvases |
| 12 | **accents** | `accents.ts` | `showAccents` | Yellow accent bars with chevron arrows and label text, hazard stripe patch, CMYK registration dots, diagonal hatching patches, small scattered crosshair (+) marks, diamond accent markers (solid and hatched) |
| 13 | **logoOverlay** | `logoOverlay.ts` | `logoVariant` | SVG logo overlay (async). Fetches SVG text (cached per variant), injects fill color + opacity, renders via Blob URL → Image → `drawImage`. Centered on canvas, scaled by `logoScale`. Color and opacity configurable via `logoColor` and `logoOpacity` |

## Caching Strategy

`renderer.ts` implements a three-tier caching system to minimize redundant work. All caches are module-scoped and persist across render calls.

### Tier 1: Terrain Data Cache

Two-level cache for the most expensive computations:

- **Heightmap cache** -- Keyed on `seed|gridWidth|gridHeight|noiseScale|octaves|persistence|lacunarity`. Skipped for all visual-only changes (toggles, colors, theme, logo).
- **Contour cache** -- Keyed on the heightmap key + `contourLevels`. Changing `contourLevels` reuses the cached heightmap and only re-runs contour extraction (much cheaper).

### Tier 2: Per-Layer OffscreenCanvas Cache

Each of the 13 layers renders to its own cached `OffscreenCanvas`. A `Map<string, LayerEntry>` stores one canvas per layer name, keyed on the config fields that affect that layer's output.

**Base key** (shared by most layers): `width|height|seed|theme|accentColor|contourColor` — covers dimensions, RNG seed, and all palette inputs.

**Layer-specific keys:**

| Layer(s) | Cache key |
|---|---|
| Most layers (background, grid, scanLines, heroText, annotations, reticles, cornerData, frames, dataPanel, accents) | Base key only |
| contourLines | Base + `contourColorMode`, `contourGlow`, `contourLevels`, terrain key |
| zones | Base + terrain key |
| logoOverlay | Base + `logoVariant`, `logoScale`, `logoOpacity`, `logoColor` |

### Tier 3: Compositing

All enabled layers are composited onto the main canvas via `ctx.drawImage()` calls in order. The background layer is opaque and covers every pixel, so no `clearRect` is needed (this prevents flash-of-white between frames). Canvas dimensions are only changed when they actually differ from the current buffer size.

### What invalidates what

| User action | Terrain data | Layers re-rendered | Compositing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Toggle a layer | cached | none | re-composite only |
| Change theme or accent color | cached | all | re-composite |
| Change contour style/glow | cached | contourLines only | re-composite |
| Change logo settings | cached | logoOverlay only | re-composite |
| Change contourLevels | heightmap cached, contours regenerated | contourLines + zones | re-composite |
| Change seed or noise params | regenerated | all | re-composite |

### Memory

Each `OffscreenCanvas` allocates a full RGBA buffer. At 2048px preview: ~130MB total for 13 layers. At ~1000px (mobile): ~40MB. Acceptable for modern devices.

## Contour Color Modes

Controlled by `config.contourColorMode` (`ContourColorMode` type):

- **`mono`** (default) -- Uniform color. Index contours use `palette.contourIndex`, others use `palette.contourLine`. Full opacity.
- **`elevation`** -- Contour color lerps from `config.contourColor` (low elevation) to `palette.accent` (high elevation) based on normalized threshold index. Hex-channel linear interpolation via `lerpColor()`.
- **`fade`** -- Same colors as mono, but opacity scales from 15% (low elevation) to 100% (high elevation). Lower contours fade out, higher ones are prominent.

### Contour Glow

`config.contourGlow` (0-1 float) layers a Canvas `shadowBlur` glow effect on top of **any** color mode. When > 0, contour strokes emit light in the accent color. Index contours glow stronger (up to 12px blur) than regular contours (up to 6px). The glow intensity is purely visual and does not affect contour geometry.

### Contour Line Color

`config.contourColor` (hex string, default `#888888`) controls the base color of contour lines independently from the theme. `getPalette()` in `color.ts` derives `palette.contourLine` and `palette.contourIndex` from this hex value using `hexToRgba()` with theme-appropriate alpha (dark: 0.25/0.45, light: 0.4/0.6).

## Color Picker

`src/components/ui/ColorPicker.tsx` is a shared component used for both accent color and contour line color selection. It provides 8 preset color swatches (yellow, red, cyan, green, purple, white, gray, black) plus a custom color button (rainbow gradient) that opens the native `<input type="color">` picker.

## State Management

Zustand flat store in `src/hooks/useWallpaperConfig.ts`. The store type is `WallpaperStore extends WallpaperConfig` -- every config field is a top-level store property (no nesting).

**Actions:**
- `setConfig(partial)` -- Shallow merge any config fields
- `setPreset(preset)` -- Switch resolution preset, updating width/height from `RESOLUTION_PRESETS` lookup
- `randomize()` -- Rerolls seed, noise params, theme, accent/contour color (linked), contour mode, glow, and all layer toggles. Resolution is preserved.
- `applyPreset(name)` -- Applies a named preset from `PRESETS` array (with fresh seed)

**Initialization:** On load, `getInitialConfig()` uses a three-tier priority chain: URL hash (shared permalink) → `localStorage` (returning user) → `DEFAULTS`. The `DEFAULTS` in `src/data/defaults.ts` always default to `'device'` preset (hardware pixel dimensions via `screen.width * devicePixelRatio`), falling back to `1080p` if detection fails.

**Backwards compatibility:** New config fields (`contourGlow`, `contourColor`, `logoVariant`, `logoScale`, `logoOpacity`, `logoColor`) use `?? defaultValue` fallbacks in both the renderer and UI components, so old permalinks without these fields still work.

## DPR / HiDPI Scaling

The canvas buffer is scaled by `devicePixelRatio` for sharp rendering on HiDPI displays. All layer code draws in logical pixel coordinates -- the transform handles physical pixel mapping.

**Preview:** `useGenerateWallpaper` fits the configured aspect ratio into the container (letterboxed when the container doesn't match). The render resolution is capped at **2048px** on the longest axis for performance; CSS sizing matches the fitted dimensions exactly so there's no stretching. The preview shows the same content as the export, just scaled down. The three-tier caching system (terrain data, per-layer OffscreenCanvas, compositing) ensures most interactions only re-render the affected layer(s).

**Export:** `exportWallpaper()` renders at full target resolution with `dpr=1` (no extra scaling), producing a pixel-exact PNG at the configured dimensions.

## Triple Font System

`src/utils/fonts.ts` provides `fontForText(text, sizePx, bold?, style?)` returning a CSS font string for canvas:

| Style | Font Stack | Usage |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| `'endfield'` | `'Endfield', 'Arial Black', 'Impact', sans-serif` | Custom decorative font. Used for hero text, accent bar labels, data panel header |
| `'standard'` | `'Inter', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial', sans-serif` | Clean sans-serif for data readouts, coordinates, grid labels |
| `'auto'` (default) | CJK regex detection -> CJK or standard | CJK text gets `'Noto Sans JP', 'Hiragino Sans', 'Yu Gothic', sans-serif`. Non-CJK falls through to standard |

## Permalink System

`src/utils/permalink.ts` implements shareable URLs and config persistence:

- **Encode**: `encodeConfig(config)` -> `JSON.stringify` -> `btoa` -> base64 string
- **Decode**: `decodeConfig(hash)` -> strip leading `#` -> `atob` -> `JSON.parse` -> validate
- **URL update**: `updateUrlHash(config)` calls `history.replaceState` to set the hash without triggering navigation. Also saves the config to `localStorage` (key: `endfield-terrain-config`) for returning users.
- **localStorage load**: `loadSavedConfig()` reads and validates from `localStorage`. Used as a fallback when no URL hash is present.
- **Hydration**: Store calls `decodeConfig(window.location.hash)` → `loadSavedConfig()` → `DEFAULTS` during initialization (first match wins).

## Important: Manual Config Field Propagation

**Two files manually list every `WallpaperConfig` field and MUST be updated when adding new config fields:**

1. **`src/hooks/useGenerateWallpaper.ts`** -- Destructures all fields from the store, rebuilds the config object, and lists every field in the `useCallback` dependency array. A missing field means config changes won't trigger re-render.
2. **`src/components/controls/ActionButtons.tsx`** -- `buildConfig()` manually copies every field from the store into a `WallpaperConfig` object. A missing field means exports and permalink copies will have incomplete config.

Both also need updating in the `PRESETS` array in `src/data/presets.ts` (each preset must specify every non-omitted config field).
